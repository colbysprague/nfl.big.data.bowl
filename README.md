# NFL Big Data Bowl 2026 - Player Trajectory Prediction

Predicting player movement trajectories while the ball is in the air during NFL passing plays.

## Visualization
Plot routes of offensive players before the ball is thrown to ultimately extract more information for prediction. 

Metadata that could be extracted
- Pocket (clean/dirty/rollout)
- Blitz (extra LB/S/C heading toward the passer and not in coverage)
- Route concept (Mesh, Flood, Verticals, etc.)
- Ball landing (was it a throw-away?)
